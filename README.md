# Dataserver-GraphQL
Graphql is normally used in conjunction with Nodejs and express, or other javascript frameworks, to create a graphql API to query, but graphql can also be implemented with Python frameworks like Django. We have here a django application that serves content with graphql using a cool library called graphene that abstracts almost all of the boilerplate from integrating graphql with Django models.

Although a code host such as GitHub may allow you to view and fork the code, this does not imply that you are authorized to use, modify, or share the software for any purpose.  Please, if you want to collaborate with the project, send me an email to aramayoreyes@gmail.com
